# Hello!
I'm Arves100, pizza guy with a passion of programming and reverse engineer wannabe.

## My stuff

* An open soruce C# emulator for GameSpy (with SDK included!): https://github.com/GameProgressive
* Game patcher for Fur Fighters PC (2000): https://github.com/arves100/ffloader
* Open source serializer and deserializer for RAD Granny2 3D file formats: https://github.com/arves100/opengr2
* A work-in-progress (possibly will never end) open source clone of Mystery Dungeon games with nCine: https://github.com/arves100/OpenMysteryToolkit
* An experimental C# emulator of Brave Frontier: https://github.com/arves100/gimufrontier

## Life goals for 2023 / Q3 2024

* Complete Crysis2 Direct2Game server emulator
* Rewrite FF Loader to v2 with some updates (perhaps EVEN a modloader or SP splitscreen)
* Complete some Tools to release for the Metin2 PServer scene (liblyketo, Server linux, binerp, mispack/lyketotool)
* Offline mod for Brave Frontier (and possibly something in decompilator regards)
* The secret linux port project (not really secret)
* Crappy release of some stuff with OMT depends on where I got during that time
* Things for mobile adapter gb (libadaptergb, mgba port)
* Some contributions I am certantly forgetting
